#### Learning PyTorch With Examples

[source](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html)

* will use fully connected ReLU network as running example

* network will have a single hidden layer, will be trained with gradient descent to fit random data by minimizing euclidean distance between network output and true output
