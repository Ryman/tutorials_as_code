* Probabilistic modeling and inference are core tools in several fields inclduing statistics, ML, computer vision, cognitive vision, cognitive science, robotics, NLP and AI.

* Implementing inference algo are often error prone, Gen simplifies it with `modeling language` using higher-level programming constructs automating aspects of inference.

* Gen includes `universal` modeling language to represent any model, including stochastic structure, discrete and continuous random variable, and simulators.

* Provides flexible modeling and inference programming to unify symbolic, neural probabilistic, and simulation based approaches to modeling and inference, including causal modeling, symbolic programming, deep learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, graphics and physics engines, and planning and reinforcement learning.

* Consists of multiple modeling languages implemented in DSLs in Julia and Julia library for inference programming.
