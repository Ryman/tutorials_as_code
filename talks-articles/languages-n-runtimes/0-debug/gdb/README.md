## GDB: The GNU Project Debugger

> Helps you debug with four primary actions
>
> * start program and specify anything that might affect its behavior
>
> * make your program stop on specified conditions
>
> * examine what happened, when program stops
>
> * change state in program, to experiment

* programs can be executed on same machine as native GDB, on remote machine, or on a simulator

> supported languages:
> `Ada`, `Assembly`, `C`, `C++`, `D`, `Fortran`, `Go`, `Objective-C`, `OpenCL`, `Modula-2`, `Pascal`, `Rust`

> online docs:
> * [user manual](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/)
> * [wiki](http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/)
> * [gdb internals](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/Internals)
