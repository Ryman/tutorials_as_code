* runs as isolated lightweight processes and message exchange

* provides `supervisor`, can restart parts of logic to last working state on fault detection

* provides `mix` to create projects, manage tasks, run tests, more

* a package manager `hex`

* get the REPL started using `iex`, can try some starter command `IO.puts "yo"`
> quit it using `Ctrl + \`; for help use `h()`
