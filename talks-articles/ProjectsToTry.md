> It's a framework for building High Availability services, and clusters. It allows clients to not have to worry about where services live, and if they die, they auto adjust their internal connection pools to adapt to changes in the cluster.

> GoQuery brings a syntax and a set of features similar to jQuery to the Go language. It is based on Go's net/html package and the CSS Selector library cascadia. Since the net/html parser returns tokens (nodes), and not a full-featured DOM object, jQuery's manipulation and modification functions have been left off (no point in modifying data in the parsed tree of the HTML, it has no effect).

* [remogatto/mandala](https://github.com/remogatto/mandala)
> Mandala is a framework for writing Android native applications in Go using the Goandroid toolchain. You can develop, test and run your application on your desktop and then deploy it to an Android device. It encourages the use of idiomatic Go for writing Android applications: communication happens through channels and not callbacks. The framework should not be considered a high-level game engine but as a basic layer onto which game engines can be built or existing ones can be used. In my opinion, this opens interesting scenarios in the developing of native Android applications/games in Go. Goandroid's native_activity example was the initial source of inspiration for this project. Early Stages.

* [zond/god](https://github.com/zond/god)
